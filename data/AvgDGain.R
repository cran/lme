### Average daily weight gain (adg) of steers fed for 160 days.  The Treatment
### is the level of medicated feed additive in the diet.  It is given as both
### an ordered factor (Treatment) and a continuous covariate (Trt).  The initial
### weight is also recorded.  The steers were housed in 8 different barns,
### the Block factor.  This is data set 5.3 from "SAS System for Mixed Models".
